 ## Description

Welcome! I would like to present to you my Express Note Taker Application!

 Here is my HEROKU link : https://fast-woodland-38422.herokuapp.com/


 Here is the link to my github : https://github.com/youjmi/Express-Note_app

 This assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

 ## Installation 

 Please install the following

 ```
 npm i
 ```

 Once everything is installed, the application will be involed by using the following command:

 ```
 node server.js
 ```

 I do want to make a special note that if you would like to see your node constantly updated, you are able to globally install NODEMON if you please. This is purely based on preferences.
